# Extracting an Image from Another Image

This solution contains 3 projects:
- problem: the project to be given to students.
- answer-key: the project that contains a possible solution to problem.
- merge-image: a simple project for an application to create a merged image.

Note: the projects currently contain an OEM license key (the ones used for the UATs). It is likely that this license will have to be removed before distributing the problem project to the students.
